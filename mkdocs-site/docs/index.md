# Introduction

If you want to learn how to interact with the Tesserae API, you've come to the right place.  The information presented here includes the promises we make about what you can expect from us, dependent on what we expect from you ("specifications", they say).  We'll also present examples to help set expectations.

Who are "we"?  We are digital humanists, associated with the Tesserae project.  We are interested in intertextual relationships, and we use computational methods to aid us in this quest.
